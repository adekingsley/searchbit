## Bitcoin Key Utilities

![Bitcoin Key Utilities](https://example.com/bitcoin_key_utilities.png)

Bitcoin Key Utilities is a Python script designed to help users perform Bitcoin arithmetic and cryptographic operations. It is intended to be a helpful tool for users who need to work with Bitcoin public and private keys, and for those who may have lost their partial private keys but still possess the corresponding public key. Please note that this script is not meant for any illegal hacking purposes but rather for legitimate Bitcoin-related activities.

Introduction
In this section, provide a brief overview of your script's purpose and main functionalities. You can also include a short code snippet demonstrating how to import and use the script.

### Bitcoin Mathematics and Public Key Generation

Before diving into the functionalities of the script, let's briefly explain some fundamental concepts related to Bitcoin key generation:

1. **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**: Bitcoin uses ECC for its key generation and cryptographic operations. The script leverages the `ecdsa` library to perform ECC operations.

2. **Public Key Generation**: The script enables users to generate Bitcoin addresses and public keys. Public keys are generated using the `ecdsa.SigningKey` class, which generates a private key, from which the corresponding public key is derived.

3. **Address Generation**: Bitcoin addresses are derived from the public key through a series of cryptographic hash functions, including SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160. The `base58` library is used to encode the address, resulting in a shorter, more human-readable representation.

4. **Weakness of Python for Brute-Force**: Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) may impact the performance of the address brute-force operation. As a result, brute-forcing Bitcoin addresses with this script might be slower compared to the public key brute-force operation.

### Usage

To use the Bitcoin Key Utilities script, open a terminal or command prompt and execute the `mym.py` script with the desired command. Below are some examples of how to use the script:


Installation
In this section, explain how to install the required dependencies and set up a virtual environment. You can refer users to use the "requirements.txt" file you've created. For example:

To install the required dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
Usage
In this section, provide detailed explanations and code examples for each function in your script. Explain the purpose of each function and its parameters. Include examples demonstrating how to use the functions in different scenarios.

1. **Generate a Bitcoin Address**:
   This command generates a new Bitcoin address and the associated private key. The private key is automatically saved locally, but it's advised to encrypt it with a password for security.

   ```bash
   python mym.py generate
   ```

2. **Decrypt User's Private Key**:
   If you have an encrypted private key and its password, you can use this command to decrypt it.

   ```bash
   python mym.py decrypt
   ```

3. **Perform Public Key Operations**:
   You can perform two types of operations on a given public key: addition and division. The result will be a new public key.

   ```bash
   # Addition
   python mym.py -m OP <public_key> <scalar_number>

   ```
    ```bash
   # Division
   python mym.py -m OP <public_key> <scalar_number>
   ```

### Address Brute-Force and Public Key Brute-Force

As mentioned earlier, the address brute-force operation might be slower due to Python's GIL. For users who have the public key but lost the private key, the public key brute-force operation could be faster. The script provides a `private_key_brute()` function for users to attempt to retrieve the private key given a target public key.

Please note that brute-forcing should only be performed for experimental purposes and on private keys that you legally own. Attempting to brute-force private keys that do not belong to you is illegal and unethical.

### Examples

In the "Examples" section, we provide real-world scenarios of using the script for Bitcoin key generation, public key operations, and address decryption. The examples demonstrate how to execute the script for various use cases.
